<h1>Hello World! (Java)</h1>

<p>To demonstrate the simplest possible use of Transport, we will create a simple class that simply
    talks to its self.</p>

<h3>Java HelloWorld</h3>
<pre class="code"><code class="language-java" ngNonBindable>import com.vmware.transport.bus.model.Message;
import com.vmware.transport.core.AbstractBase;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Component;

@Component
public class HelloWorld extends AbstractBase &#123;

    // define a channel.
    private String myChannel;

    // initialize is the only mandatory method required. This will always run on boot.
    public void initialize() &#123;

        // create a local channel.
        myChannel = "myChannel";

        // create a responder
        this.createResponder();
        this.sendRequest();
    &#125;

    // send a response to a request.
    private void createResponder() &#123;
        this.bus.respondOnce(myChannel,
                (Message msg) -> msg.getPayload().toString() + " world"
        );
    &#125;

    // send a request
    private void sendRequest() &#123;
        this.bus.requestOnce(myChannel, "hello",
                (Message msg) -> &#123;
                    this.logInfoMessage("HelloWorld:", "Got a response! ", msg.getPayload().toString());
                &#125;
        );
    &#125;
&#125;</code></pre>

<p>The output of the component is pretty basic. If you look at your console, you will see something like this</p>

<pre class="log-output">2021-03-20 22:19:37.229 <span class="console-green">DEBUG</span> <span class="console-pink">1526</span> --- [main] <span class="console-blue">com.vmware.transport.bus.EventBusImpl</span>      : 🔹  <span class="console-grey">Initializing Transport Service: HelloWorld</span>
2021-03-20 22:19:37.248 <span class="console-green">INFO</span>  <span class="console-pink">1526</span> --- [main] <span class="console-blue">samples.HelloWorld</span>                         : <span class="console-grey">HelloWorld:  Got a response!:</span> <strong class="console-pink">hello world</strong>
</pre>

<h3>Breakdown of what is happening</h3>

<p>
    The first requirement is to annotate your class with the <code class="clr-code">@Component</code> annotation provided by Spring. This marks your class as a
    Spring Bean, meaning it will be picked up and loaded automatically.
</p>

<pre class="code"><code class="language-java" ngNonBindable>@Component
public class HelloWorld extends AbstractBase &#123;
    // ...
&#125;
</code></pre>

<p>
    The next step is to ensure your class extends from <code class="clr-code">AbstractBase</code>. This is the same as the TypeScript version, however the
    Java version is mandatory, where the TypeScript version is optional.
</p>
<p>
    When you extend from <code class="clr-code">AbstractBase</code>. You're also implementing the <code class="clr-code">TransportEnabled</code> interface, which has
    a single method you need to implement. <code class="clr-code">initialize()</code>
</p>

<pre class="code"><code class="language-java" ngNonBindable>@Component
public class HelloWorld extends AbstractBase &#123;
    public initialize() &#123;
        // ...
    &#125;
&#125;
</code></pre>

<p>
    <code class="clr-code">initialize()</code> is your start point. You can use a Constructor, however you may not have access to the event bus at that point. It's
    <strong class="emphasis">Highly Recommended</strong> that you kick off anything you want to run from this method and <strong class="emphasis">Not the constructor.</strong>
</p>

<p>
    The rest of the example simply sets up a responder and sends a request on the <code class="clr-code">myChannel</code> channel. The API is similar to the
    TypeScript API, with a few small differences. There is no <code class="clr-code">handle()</code> method. You simply pass in your lambdas as and argument.
</p>
<hr/>

<h3>Why is the API slightly different to TypeScript?</h3>

<p>
    Java and TypeScript are completely different languages that operate in very different ways. TypeScript isn't executed, it's transpiled to JavaScript.
    All languages are different and bring their own designs, we have tried to keep the APIs as close as possible where it makes sense. We have used language specific
    techniques and designs in some places however.
