<h1>Extending local channels to be 'Galactic' Channels.</h1>

<p>
    Extending channels is the concept of being able to decide which channels you extend to a broker, and how you map them to destinations on those brokers.
</p>

<h2>Galactic Channels</h2>

<p>
    When Transport was being developed, it was originally had a code name of 'BifrÃ¶st'. The term 'Galactic' Channel, stems from the idea that you could extend a channel to any other destination, on any compatible broker.
</p>
<p>
    Essentially, marking a channel as galactic <strong class="emphasis">extends it to a broker destination</strong>, marking it as local <strong class="emphasis">boxes it to the local application</strong> only.
</p>
<hr/>
<h2>Marking a channel as Galactic</h2>

<p>
    Use the <a href="https://github.com/vmware/transport-typescript/blob/master/src/bus.api.ts#L446"><code class="clr-code">bus.markChannelAsGalactic()</code></a> method. You can supply a broker identity, if you're
    using multiple brokers, to make sure you don't extend channels to all brokers.
</p>

<pre class="code"><code class="language-typescript" ngNonBindable>this.bus.markChannelAsGalactic('simple-stream');</code></pre>

<p> To stop extending a channel, use the <code class="clr-code">bus.markChannelAsLocal()</code> method</p>

<pre class="code"><code class="language-typescript" ngNonBindable>this.bus.markChannelAsLocal('simple-stream');</code></pre>

<hr/>

<h2>Private Channels (Topics)</h2>

<p>
    If you're using the <a routerLink="/java/overview">Java</a> or  <a routerLink="/golang/overview">Golang</a> version of Transport as your backend/service broker, you can use the optional  <code class="clr-code">isPrivate</code> argument and set it to true. This will use a queue instead of a topic
    to communicate with your backend service. This is important if you don't want other clients or components in your applications to pick up this traffic.

<h4>
    Using <a href="https://github.com/vmware/transport-typescript/blob/master/src/fabric.api.ts#L92"><code class="clr-code">this.fabric.generateFabricRequest</code></a>?
</h4>

<p>
    This method creates a fabric ready request, capable of being routed across to services that are listening on remote / galactic channels, and that are using the Transport Java or Golang.
    You supply a command and an optional payload to send.
</p>
<h4>
    Can I message over galactic channels without using  <a href="https://github.com/vmware/transport-typescript/blob/master/src/fabric.api.ts#L92"><code class="clr-code">this.fabric.generateFabricRequest</code></a>?
</h4>
<p>
    Yes. You can send what ever you like.

    ðŸ‘‰ Use requests that operate over ID's or Transactions instead of public requests/responses to avoid crosstalk. ðŸ‘ˆ
