<h1>Stores and Advanced use</h1>

<p>
    It's not really advanced, but you know, a little more functionality that just a map of maps. Stores can be
    subscribed to for state changes and initializations, as well as delegate
    mutation requests to business logic that handles API calls to mutate those models.
</p>
<p>
    Let's first start with understanding how I can be notified when state in a store has changed.
</p>

<h2>
    Listening for state changes in a store.
</h2>

<p>
    You can listen for any kind of state change on your store (state changes are defined by you), you can also listen
    for multiple state changes, not just a single one. You can decide to listen for an update to a single object, or all
    objects in the store.
</p>
<p>
    Two methods provide access to streams that can be subscribed to. The first one will tick any time any object is
    affected by any state change (you care about) in a store, this is
    <code class="clr-code">onAllChanges&lt;S&gt;(...stateChangeType: S[]): StoreStream&lt;T&gt;</code>
</p>

<p>
    The second one tick any time a specific object is affected by any state change (you care about) in a store, this is
    <code class="clr-code">onChange&lt;S&gt;(id: UUID, ...stateChangeType: S[]): StoreStream&lt;T&gt;</code>
</p>


<h3>Listening for State Changes on 'MyObject' Store</h3>
<pre class="code"><code class="language-typescript" ngNonBindable>// Listen for 'Added' state changes in 'myStore'
myStore.onAllChanges(MyObjectState.Added)
    .subscribe(
        (updatedObject: MyObject) => &#123;
            // do something interesting with this newly added thing.
        &#125;
    );

// Listen for 'Sleeping' and 'Changed' state changes in 'myStore'
myStore.onAllChanges(MyObjectState.Sleeping, MyObjectState.Changed)
    .subscribe(
        (updatedObject: MyObject) => &#123;
            // do something interesting with this changed or sleeping thing.
        &#125;
    );</code></pre>

<p>
    You should notice that the return type of these methods is <code class="clr-code">StoreStream&lt;T&gt;</code>. This
    interface provides you two simple methods: <code class="clr-code">subscribe(successHandler: MessageFunction&lt;T&gt;):
    Subscription</code> and<code class="clr-code">unsubscribe(): void</code>.
</p>
<p>
    Just like RxJS, this allows you subscribe to updates from the
    store for which ever object(s) you're interested in. You can also unsubscribe from the stream as well, when you no
    longer care about subscriptions. The return type of the <code class="clr-code">subscribe()</code> method is an RxJS
    <code class="clr-code">Subscription</code>
    object, which you can use at your leisure if you want.

<h2>Waiting for a store to be available - <span class="emphasis">dealing with race conditions</span></h2>

<p>
    There are times when you need to ensure that components don't start pulling state from a store, before that store is
    ready. Normally you would define a process to bootstrap a store, populate it with data and then inform every
    consumer of that store, that the store is ready. There are a few ways to 'wait for a store to be ready'.
</p>

<h3>Using <code class="clr-code">whenReady()</code></h3>

<p>
    The first approach is to use the <code class="clr-code">myStore.whenReady(readyFunction: MessageFunction&lt;Map&lt;UUID,
    T&gt;&gt;)</code> method. This allows you to pass a lambda in that will be passed the contents of the store when
    it's been
    'initialized'. This will execute asynchronously. This is the simplest way to wait for a store's state to be set up
    before consuming it.
</p>

<h3>Using whenReady() on 'myStore'</h3>
<pre class="code"><code class="language-typescript" ngNonBindable>import &#123; UUID &#125; from '@vmware/transport';

// Wait for store to be ready using whenReady();
let myData: Array&lt;MyObject&gt; = [];

myStore.whenReady(
    (storeContents: Map&lt;UUID, MyObject&gt;) =>  &#123;

            // set myData.
            myData = storeContents.values();
        &#125;
    );

...
// ... somewhere else, initialize the store when it's loaded up.
myStore.initialize();</code></pre>


<div class="alert alert-info" role="alert">
    <div class="alert-items">
        <div class="alert-item static">
            <div class="alert-icon-wrapper">
                <clr-icon class="alert-icon" shape="info-circle"></clr-icon>
            </div>
            <span class="alert-text">

                You can also use <code class="clr-code">myStore.populate()</code> to initialize the store. When you use <code
                class="clr-code">populate()</code>,
         the store is not only populated with bootstrapped state - it also initializes. Both will be broadcast to any consumer using <code
                class="clr-code">whenReady()</code>.

            </span>
        </div>
    </div>
</div>

<hr/>

<h3>Using <code class="clr-code">readyJoin()</code> <span class="emphasis"> for multiple stores</span></h3>
<p>
    The second approach is for when you need to wait for <strong>multiple stores</strong> to be ready. This method is
    available via <code class="clr-code">this.storeManager</code>. It's not attached to a particular store, as this
    functionality is designed to wait for multiple stores to be available. <code class="clr-code">this.storeManager.readyJoin(stores:
    Array&lt;StoreType&gt;): StoreReadyResult</code> returns an object of type <code class="clr-code">StoreReadyResult</code>.
</p>
<p>
    This interface provides the same method name as the store based approach as <code class="clr-code">whenReady()</code>.
    Except this doesn't deliver the contents of a store to the handling function, as all stores are being waited on and
    the amount of data coming in could be significant.
</p>

<h3>Using readyJoin() for multiple stores.</h3>
<pre class="code"><code class="language-typescript" ngNonBindable>// Create stores
this.storeManager.createStore('store1');
this.storeManager.createStore('store2');
this.storeManager.createStore('store3');

// wait for all stores to be ready
this.storeManager.readyJoin(['store1', 'store2', 'store3'])
        .whenReady(
            () => &#123;
                // stores are ready... do something fun.
            &#125;
        );

// ... somewhere else, initialize stores.
store1.initialize();
store2.initialize();
store3.initialize();</code></pre>

<hr/>


<h3>Using Transactions <span class="emphasis"> - preferred approach for multiple stores</span>&nbsp;✨</h3>

<p>
    Transactions are the cleanest way to wait for multiple stores to be ready. You can combine requests/responses and
    waiting for stores to be ready into a single transaction.
</p>

<pre class="code"><code class="language-typescript" ngNonBindable>// Create stores
this.storeManager.createStore&lt;string&gt;('store1');
this.storeManager.createStore&lt;string&gt;('store2');
this.storeManager.createStore&lt;string&gt;('store3');

// create transaction.
const transaction: Transaction = this.bus.createTransaction();

// register transaction complete handler.
transaction.onComplete(
            (results: string[]) => &#123;
                    // do something with fun with your results.

            &#125;
        );

// register stores with transaction.
transaction.waitForStoreReady('store1');
transaction.waitForStoreReady('store2');
transaction.waitForStoreReady('store3');

// commit transaction.
transaction.commit();

// ... somewhere else, initialize stores.
store1.initialize();
store2.initialize();
store3.initialize();</code></pre>
