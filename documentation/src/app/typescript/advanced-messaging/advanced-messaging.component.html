<h1>Advanced Messaging Concepts</h1>

<p>The basic concept of Transport is simple, but sometimes you need more control, like direct or broadcast conversations
within channels. Some times you need to make sure you don't want conversations mixed up multiple components are messaging
services, or listening for specific responses on a s</p>

<h3>Understanding 'broadcast' vs 'direct' messaging</h3>

<p>
    Transport is analogous to Slack (for software), except Transport allows direct messages inside a channel, where
    as Slack opens up stand-alone conversations between actors outside of a channel.
    The concept however remains the same. When a component needs to restrict a conversation between its self, and a
    service - we can use a direct message.
</p>
<p>
    When a component is interested in everything being broadcast by a service, then that component can simply
    subscribe to the service channel and listen for everything.
</p>

<p>
    The use case for direct messaging between a component and service arrives when you need a specific response to be
    delivered to a specific component, i.e. you don't want every component
    getting that same response (because we're operating on a single channel). It's like talking in a public chat, vs
    talking in a direct message with that service.

<h3>Sending requests using ID's</h3>

<p>
    There are multiple ways to conduct direct messaging between a component and a service. The first is to use methods in the
    API that accept an ID. Every API e.g.  <code class="clr-code">requestOnce()</code>
    has multiple variations, one is the same method name that has <code class="clr-code">...withId()</code> appended to
    the end of the name.

</p>
<p>
    another is <code class="clr-code">...withIdAndVersion()</code>.
    The signature for both is mostly the same, except they obviously take an ID, or an ID and a version.
</p>
<p>
    Let's take a look at an example of using one of these methods:
</p>
<pre class="code"><code class="language-typescript" ngNonBindable>const request: PongServiceRequest = &#123;
    command: PongRequestType.Basic,
    message: 'basic ping'
&#125;;

this.bus.requestOnceWithId&lt;PongServiceRequest, PongServiceResponse&gt;(
    '123456',           // message id
    PongServiceChannel, // channel on which to send request
    request,            // payload to be sent on the channel
    PongServiceChannel, // channel on which to listen for response **
    'PingComponent'     // optional identifier of requesting component
).handle(
    (response: PongServiceResponse) =&gt; &#123;
        // do something with this successful request
    &#125;,
    (error: GeneralError) =&gt; &#123;
        // something went wrong, lets handle it.
    &#125;
);</code></pre>

<p class="p5">
    <strong>**</strong> In earlier versions of Transport, we used to use a different return channel for responses,
    this design has been phased out, however you can still use it
    if you need to. We're using the same request and response channel (preferred design).
</p>
<p>
    The above example will send a request to <code class="clr-code">PongService</code>, but this time, we're sending
    that message with an ID of <strong>123456</strong>. This means that the component
    is only going to listen for a response that <strong>also contains that same ID</strong>. Any other response coming
    in over <code class="clr-code">PongServiceChannel</code> that has a different ID, or
    has no ID <strong>will be ignored</strong> by the <code class="clr-code">handle(...)</code> method.
</p>

<h3>Quick note on generating UUID's</h3>
<p>
    In the example above, we used <strong>123456</strong> as an ID for the message. This isn't very scalable and really
    you should not be worrying about generating these ID's, particularly because there
    could be thousands of messages being passed around channels. ID's should be generated instead of manually created.
</p>
<p>
    There is a simple utility provided by the event bus that allows you to do this easily.
    By using <code class="clr-code">GeneralUtil</code>, you can generate full, or short UUID's. You can import <code
    class="clr-code">GeneralUtil</code> from <code class="clr-code">@vmware/transport/util/util</code>.
</p>
<p>
    It's pretty simple to use as well, all the methods are static.
</p>

<pre class="code"><code class="language-typescript" ngNonBindable>GeneralUtil.genUUID();      // generates full 128bit random UUID
GeneralUtil.genUUIDShort(); // generates full 128bit random UUID, but truncates to only the first 8 characters.</code></pre>
