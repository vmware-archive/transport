<p>
    This implementation is designed to operate in the Browser (for right now anyway). However it is <strong>framework agnostic</strong>,
    and will work along-side any UI framework you want to implement.
</p>
<p>
    Transport does not care which framework you would like to run. It's directly accessible from the <code>window</code>
    object, if you don't even want to use a framework. We're using examples from Angular and React in places, however
    the same principals would apply in any framework.

<section *ngFor="let cmd of tsCommands; index as i">
    <h4 class="code-step">{{cmd.title}}</h4>
    <transport-animated-console [inputCommand]="cmd.command"
                                [helperTxt]="cmd.notes"
                                [consoleTheme]="'macOS'"
                                [loopAnimation]="false"
                                [delay]="i * 1000">
    </transport-animated-console>
