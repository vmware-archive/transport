<h1>Using Transactions with Transport</h1>
<p>
    Another technique that can be used to encapsulate a conversation between a component and a service, or between
    services themselves - is to use a transaction.
</p>
<p>
    Transactions via transport are not traditional transactions, in the sense that they can be rolled back if they fail, instead they are defined as a
    group of requests and responses that have to occur before the transaction can be considered complete.
</p>
<p>
    For example, if you need to call a number of services to get a number of responses, in order to be able to construct
    a response for a component - this would be a transactions.

</p>
<p>
    Similarly if you need to make a number of calls to services and wait for stores to be available and populated, this would also be a
    transaction. Transactions can be either synchronous, or asynchronous.
</p>
<p>
    Transactions are asynchronous by default. Essentially when you commit transactions, all the requests will be fired
    at once, the transaction will complete once responses to all those requests have been
    completed. These responses can arrive in any order and at any time (hence the asynchronous nature).
</p>
<p>
    However there may be times when you want your logic to run in a synchronous manner
    (due to your API design for example). When running a synchronous transaction, each request in the transaction will
    only fire once the previous one has completed. This is obviously a lot slower,
    but may be required based on your needs.
</p>

<p>
    Below is an example of another component that calls <code class="clr-code">PongService</code> three times, via a
    transaction
</p>

<p>Try it below, you can see three requests come back all made at different times, indicated by the detailed timing.</p>

<p>
    If you have logging enabled (debug or verbose), you should see something like the following output in your developer console.<br/>

<p>
    All of the underlying handling of requests, responses and mappings are encapsulated by the transaction. Each request
    has it's own ID and is individually tracked by the
    transaction, this allows any number of transactions to be operating simultaneously at any one time on a channel.
