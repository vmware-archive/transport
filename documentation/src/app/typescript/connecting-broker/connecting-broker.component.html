<h3>Connecting to a broker</h3>

<p>
    If you're using the Java or Golang version of Transport, they both come with a local, very simple broker that you can run. However because Transport uses <a href="http://stomp.github.io/" target="_blank">STOMP</a>, it means
    you can connect directly to any STOMP compatible broker (like RabbitMQ for example).
</p>

<h4>How do I connect my bus to a broker?</h4>

<p>
    We've tried to keep this as simple as possible. You should really just need to provide a connected and disconnected event handler.
</p>

<pre class="code"><code class="language-typescript" ngNonBindable>// Set up the bus, before we load any of the app.
const bus: EventBus = BusUtil.bootBusWithOptions(LogLevel.Debug, false, true);

// Called when connected to broker
const connectedHandler = (sessionId: string) => &#123;
    bus.logger.info(`Connected to Broker with sessionId $&#123;sessionId&#125;`, 'main.ts');
&#125;;

// Called when disconnected.
const disconnectedHandler = () => &#123;
    bus.logger.info('Disconnected from Broker.', 'main.ts');
&#123;

// Connect to Broker, this a real working end-point.
bus.fabric.connect(connectedHandler, disconnectedHandler, 'transport-bus.io', 443, '/ws', true);
</code></pre>

<p>
    If you need to configure the endpoint, host, port etc, you can also pass those in also as optional args.
</p>
<hr/>
<p>
    Disconnecting is easy, you'll go offline instantly.
</p>

<h4>Disconnecting from broker</h4>
<pre class="code"><code class="language-typescript" ngNonBindable>// Disconnect (close socket completely).
this.fabric.disconnect();</code></pre>

<h3>How does my application monitor the broker connection state?</h3>

<p>
    How do I know if my application gets knocked offline? What if there is a hiccup on the WebSocket? The <code class="clr-code">this.fabric.whenConnectionStateChanges()</code>
    returns a <code class="clr-code">StoreStream&lt;FabricConnectionState&gt;</code> instance, that will stream connection state changes to the consumer.
</p>
<p>
    There are three different state changes emitted from this stream.
</p>
<ol class="list">
    <li><code class="clr-code">FabricConnectionState.Connected</code> - <span class="emphasis">Broker connected!</span></li>
    <li><code class="clr-code">FabricConnectionState.Disconnected</code> - <span class="emphasis">Broker disconnected!</span></li>
    <li><code class="clr-code">FabricConnectionState.Failed</code> - <span class="emphasis">Broker unable to connect!</span></li>
</ol>

<h4>Using whenConnectionStateChanges()</h4>
<pre class="code"><code class="language-typescript" ngNonBindable>import &#123; FabricApi, FabricConnectionState &#125; from '@vmw/transport/fabric.api';

this.fabric.whenConnectionStateChanges()
    .subscribe(
        (stateChange: FabricConnectionState) => &#123;
            switch (stateChange) &#123;
                case FabricConnectionState.Connected:
                    // .. do something, now we're online.
                    break;

                case FabricConnectionState.Disconnected:
                    // .. do something, now we're offline.
                    break;

                case FabricConnectionState.Failed:
                    // .. do something important, we can't connect!
                    break;
                &#125;
            &#125;
     );
