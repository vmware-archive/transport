<h1>Transport For TypeScript Changelog</h1>

<p>
    This project has been around for a while inside VMware. This is a history of how it has evolved and what
    we changed, as we figured things out along the way. It originally started life inside of the <a href="https://vmc.vmware.com/home">VMware Cloud Console</a>
    (it's still there, humming away at scale).
