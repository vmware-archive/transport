<h1>Understanding and using Stores.</h1>

<h3>Stores are used to represent source-of-truth state in your applications.</h3>
<p>

</p>

<p>
    Transport provides a very simple API for creating a single source of truth for state inside your app.
</p>

<p>
    The store API has no dependencies on other frameworks. The design was lifted from <a href="http://www.ehcache.org/" target="_blank">EHCache</a>,
    a well known, supported and widely used industry standard cache platform for Java.
</p>
<p>
    You can create as many different stores as you like, each store should ideally contain a single type of object
    mixing objects types in a store is generally a bad design. For each type of object you want to maintain state for, you would create a store for that
    object. Once you have created a store, you can populate it with an existing single object collection of objects.
</p>
<p>
    The store you create is essentially a hash map of key's to values. When you put an object into your store, you give it a unique key (which is a string
    you define). Once an object is in the store, every and any actor inside your application can pull that specific object (or all objects) from that
    store as there is only a single instance of the store inside your application. There is no defined limit to the
    number of stores you can create and the number of objects you can keep in that store.
</p>

<h2>Creating Stores</h2>

<p>
    Every class that extends from <code class="clr-code">AbstractBase</code> or <code
    class="clr-code">AbstractCore</code> will receive a reference to <code class="clr-code">this.storeManager</code>.
    This object has has a type of
    <code class="clr-code"><a href="https://github.com/vmware/transport-typescript/blob/master/src/store.api.ts">BusStoreApi</a></code>.
</p>
<p>
    In order to create a store, you can use the method
    <code class="clr-code">this.storeManager.createStore(objectType: StoreType, map?: Map&lt;UUID, T&gt;)</code>.
    The only mandatory argument is the 'type' of the store (<code class="clr-code">StoreType</code>) which is actually
    just a string. The second argument allows you to pass a pre-populated map to the store that will populate it with
    all the key / values of the supplied map.
</p>

<h3>Creating 'MyObject' Store</h3>
<pre class="code"><code class="language-typescript" ngNonBindable>interface MyObject &#123;
    message: string
&#125;

// create a store called 'MyObject' that holds instances of MyObject
const myStore: BusStore&lt;MyObject&gt; = this.storeManager.createStore&lt;MyObject&gt;('MyObject');</code></pre>

<p>
    You have just created an empty store that is named 'MyObject' that is now supposed to hold objects of type <code class="clr-code">MyObject</code>. <strong>You can only create a store once</strong>, it exists as a singleton.
    If you make another call to create a store with the same name/object type definition - you will receive a reference to the same (already created and existing store).
</p>

<p>
    <code class="clr-code">this.storeManager.createStore()</code> is safe to use always to gain a reference to your store, it won't re-create it, if it already exists.
</p>

<hr/>

<h2>Populating Stores</h2>

<p>
    When you create a store, you can pass a map containing all your key/value pairs. This will instantly create,
    populate and activate the store. However if you would like to perform this operation later on, you can do so by
    calling the <code class="clr-code">populateStore()</code> method and passing in your values.
</p>
<p>
    When you use <code class="clr-code">myStore.populateStore(Map&lt;K,V&gt;)</code>, your store will be marked as initialized. When a
    store is initialized, any actor inside your application that is waiting
    for that store to be ready (see below), will be notified and receive updates on any objects they are interested in.
</p>

<h3>Populating 'MyObject' Store</h3>
<pre class="code"><code class="language-typescript" ngNonBindable>// Populate store with initial state
const initialData: Map&lt;string, MyObject&gt; = new Map();
initialData.put('123', &#123; message: 'pretty' &#125;);
initialData.put('456', &#123; message: 'kitty' &#125;);

myStore.populateStore(initData);</code></pre>

<hr/>

<h2>Creating, Reading, Updating and Deleting objects from a Store</h2>
<p>
    Once you have a reference to a store, you can easily add, update and remove items
    from that store using the <code class="clr-code">put(), get()</code> and <code class="clr-code">remove()</code>
    methods on that store.
</p>

<p>
    One of the concepts to know about the store is that it uses a 'bring your own state change types' model, Batteries not included here.
    This means you can define your own state changes, beyond CRUD style events (if you want)
</p>


<h3>Adding and removing stuff from 'MyObject' Store</h3>
<pre class="code"><code class="language-typescript" ngNonBindable>// define our own state changes
enum MyObjectState &#123;
    Added,
    Changed,
    Sleeping
&#125;

// add new object
myStore.put('789', &#123; message: 'happy' &#125;, MyObjectState.Added);

// replace object
myStore.put('789', &#123; message: 'puppy' &#125;, MyObjectState.Changed);

// delete object
myStore.remove('789', MyObjectState.Sleeping);</code></pre>


<h3>Getting stuff from 'MyObject' Store</h3>
<pre class="code"><code class="language-typescript" ngNonBindable>// Get single objects from store
const myObject_123: MyObject = myStore.get('123');
const myObject_456: MyObject = myStore.get('456');

// get all objects from store
const myObjects: Array&lt;MyObject&gt; = myStore.allValues();

// get all objects from a store as a map.
const myObjectsMap: Map&lt;string, MyObject&lt; = myStore.allValuesAsMap();</code></pre>
