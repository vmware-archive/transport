                                    Transport is an event bus, that allows application developers to build components
                                    that can talk to one another, really easily.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    It provides a standardized and simple API, implemented in multiple languages, to
                                    allow any individual component inside your applications
                                    to talk to one another.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    It really comes to life when you use it to send messages, requests, responses and
                                    events around your backend and front-end. Your Java or Golang backend can stream
                                    messages to your UI components, as if they were sitting right next to each other.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    Channels can be extended to major brokers like Kafka or RabbitMQ, so Transport
                                    becomes an 'on/off-ramp' for your main sources of truth.
                                </p>

                        <h2>Why is using this different from using Kafka or RabbitMQ?</h2>
                        <h3 class="sub-title">
                            Transport standardizes, encapsulates and simplifies pub-sub, so you don't have to know it's
                            there.

                            Managing observables, subscriptions, connections, sessions, web-sockets, wire protocols,
                            payloads, transactions, receipts and more is a massive pain in the neck. This is all stuff
                            and engineer does not want to have to waste time on, when trying to get a backend to stream
                            data from a backend or service, to a client or UI. Wasting hours and hours trying
                            to configure, test, debug, discover and wire the required components together.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Transport handles all that for you.</strong>

                            If you want to take a shower, you turn on the tap and water comes out. The water comes from
                            the main high pressure pipe outside your home in the street. The water makes its way from
                            the main
                            pipe in the street, into your house via plumbing, and is then streamed into your shower by a
                            tap.
                        </p>

                        <h4>Transport is the equivalent of the <strong>water pipes and taps</strong> in your house.</h4>
                        <h4>Kafka or RabbitMQ would be the equivalent of the <strong>main pipe</strong> in the street.
                        </h4>

                            It's used in a number of different products, in multiple
                            different ways. It was created to solve very real and consistent problems engineers and architects
                            face when building reactive and event driven, asynchronous applications.
