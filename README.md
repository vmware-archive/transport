# Transport

Transport is a full stack, simple, fast, expandable application event bus for your applications.

### What does that mean?

Transport is an event bus, that allows application developers to build components that can talk to one another, really easily.

It provides a standardized and simple API, implemented in multiple languages, to allow any individual component inside your applications to talk to one another.

It really comes to life when you use it to send messages, requests, responses and events around your backend and front-end. Your Java or Golang backend can stream messages to your UI components, as if they were sitting right next to each other.

Channels can be extended to major brokers like Kafka or RabbitMQ, so Transport becomes an 'on/off-ramp' for your main sources of truth.
